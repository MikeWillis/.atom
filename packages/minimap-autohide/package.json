  "readme": "# minimap-autohide package\n\n## Hide your minimap until you need it.\n\nThis package automatically hides the minimap until you need it.\n\nWhen editing normally, you have the entire window for your editor. As soon as you begin to scroll, the minimap appears and you can interact with it normally.\n\nWritten by @JayKuri - If you like it, say Hi!\n\n![Minimap autohide animated image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jayk/minimap-autohide/master/screenshot.gif)\n\nBy default the minimap will be hidden when not scrolling, and will slide out from the right when scrolling.  You can, however, tweak the appearance. When you are scrolling, the minimap will have a class 'scrolling' added to it. You can therefore override the default by adding an entry to your personal styles.less file.\n\nFor example, this style entry restores the original look of the minimap, but causes the minimap to instantly disappear when not scrolling... for a more 'snap-in' effect.\n\n    atom-text-editor::shadow {\n      atom-text-editor-minimap.scrolling {\n        left: 0px;\n        display: block;\n      }\n      atom-text-editor-minimap {\n        background: rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\n        position: relative;\n        display: none;\n        left: 0px;\n        opacity: 1;\n      }\n    }\n\nLikewise, if you don't like the semi-transparent background, you can override it in your theme:\n\n    atom-text-editor-minimap {\n      // give us a nice dark-blue background\n      background: #000040;\n    }\n\nKnown issues: Does not interact well with 'minimap-on-left' setting. You may, however, be able to set a style in your own styles.less that would allow it to work.\n",
