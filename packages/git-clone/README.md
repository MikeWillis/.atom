# git-clone atom editor plugin

Clone a git repository from atom's Command Palette and open in a new atom window. This is just a way to quickly load a repo up into atom.

`Command Palette > Git Clone: Clone`

The default directory that git clones into is `/tmp`. This can be changed in the settings.
